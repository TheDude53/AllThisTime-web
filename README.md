# All This Time: Web Edition
A text adventure game from [DudeBot Multimedia Studios](https://dudebot-official.glitch.me/#/mms/home).

## Description
It's the future. You work inside the city the machines made, processing widgets at a factory. When a picture of the Moon gives you the key a self-destruct switch, will you do what's right or do what's necessary?

## Why did you make this?
Back in March 2017, Jonathan Coulton released [the music video for All This Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvVNxqosZ7s), a song from his new album Solid State. The music video was based around a text adventure game, complete with retro graphics and keyboard clacking. In the comments section, people were praising the style and storyline of the game. Someone even suggested that JoCo start writing text adventures full-time. Being a web developer and a huge JoCo fan, I figured I'd try and turn this into an actual game people could play. JoCo greenlit the project, and here we are now.

## Sounds great, how do I play?
